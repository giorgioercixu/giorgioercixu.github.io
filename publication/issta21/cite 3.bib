abstract = {Configuration error injection testing (CEIT) could systematically evaluate software
reliability and diagnosability to runtime configuration errors. This paper explores
the challenges and opportunities of applying CEIT technique. We build an extensible,
highly-modularized CEIT framework named CeitInspector to experiment with various CEIT
techniques. Using CeitInspector, we quantitatively measure the effectiveness and efficiency
of CEIT using six mature and widely-used server applications. During this process,
we find a fair number of test cases are left unstudied by the prior research work.
The injected configuration errors in these cases often indicate latent misconfigurations,
which might be ticking time bombs in the system and lead to severe damage. We conduct
an in-depth study regarding these cases to reveal the root causes, and explore possible
remedies. Finally, we come up with actionable suggestions guided by our study to improve
the effectiveness and efficiency of the existing CEIT techniques.},
